## Nearest-Earth-Objects-1910-2024
# More than 300k NASA records about N.E.O. (Nearest-Earth-Objects)☄️
In this project, you will work with a real-world dataset that tracks Nearest Earth Objects (NEOs) 
observed by NASA from 1910 to 2024. The dataset contains [ 338,199 ] records, each representing 
an object in space that has been monitored for its proximity to Earth. Some of these objects are 
classified by NASA as "is_hazardous," indicating that they pose a potential danger to our planet. 
Your task is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a NEO is 
hazardous or not. This is a critical task, as the ability to accurately identify dangerous objects 
could be vital for planetary defense.


(Asteroid (4179) Tautatis is a potentially dangerous object passing at a distance of 2.3 times the distance from the Moon. (available in our dataset))

There are many dangerous bodies in space, one of them is  [ N.E.O ]. - "Nearest Earth Objects". Some such bodies really pose a danger to the planet Earth, NASA classifies them as "is_hazardous". This dataset contains ALL NASA observations of similar objects from 1910 to 2024!!!

There are 338,199 records of N.E.O. in the Dataset!
Try to predict "is_hazardous" as accurately as possible! (otherwise we will not be ready for an asteroid attack)


1. Data Importing and Cleaning : 
--- Begin by importing the dataset and addressing any missing values. Ensuring the data is clean and reliable is essential for the success of your model.
   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
--- Explore the data thoroughly using EDA techniques. Use visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create informative graphs that reveal patterns, trends and potential correlations within the dataset.
   
3. Data Preprocessing : 
--- Prepare the data for modeling by performing necessary preprocessing steps. This includes feature selection, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling 
numerical features where needed.

To address this, consider techniques such as: 
■. Oversampling (e.g., SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) 
■. Undersampling 
■. Class Weight Adjustment 
■. Use of Balanced Accuracy as a Metric to ensure the model performs well on both classes. 

4. Model Training and Evaluation: 
--- Train one or more machine learning models using the preprocessed data. Make sure to select the best-performing model based on these metrics.
